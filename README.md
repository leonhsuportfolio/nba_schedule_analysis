## Project Objective

The goal of this analysis is to quantify the isolated impact of schedule difficulty on an NBA team's regular-season performance. Specifically, this project seeks to determine how many wins a team gained or lost purely due to its schedule's structure (opponent strength, travel, and rest days), independent of the team's inherent quality.

## Methodology Overview

To achieve this, an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model with team and season fixed effects was developed to predict individual game outcomes. The model's predictions for each team's actual schedule were then compared against a counterfactual "neutral" schedule baseline. The difference between these two scenarios reveals the net number of wins attributable solely to schedule variance.

## Executive Summary: Key Findings

The analysis revealed that schedule difficulty can account for a swing of several wins over a season. For instance, across the five seasons analyzed (2019-2024), teams like the Los Angeles Clippers consistently faced one of the league's toughest schedules, costing them an estimated 4-5 wins, while teams like the Utah Jazz benefited from comparatively lighter schedules. The model confirms that while team strength is the primary driver of wins, schedule luck is a statistically significant factor in a team's final record.
